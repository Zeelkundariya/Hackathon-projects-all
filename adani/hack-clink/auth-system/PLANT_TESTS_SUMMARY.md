# PLANT COMPARISON TESTS A-Z - COMPLETE SUMMARY

## Overview
Comprehensive plant comparison testing from A-Z with 26 test plants across 6 scenarios and specialized analysis.

## Key Results

### 🏆 Top Performers
1. **Plant E** - Dominates most scenarios (1.16 max score)
2. **Plant Y** - Consistent high performer (0.95 avg score)  
3. **Plant O** - Strong across all scenarios (0.95 avg score)
4. **Plant I** - Very high efficiency (0.95 avg score)
5. **Plant U** - Reliable performer (0.93 avg score)

### 📊 Test Coverage
- **26 Plants**: A-Z with varying characteristics
- **6 Scenarios**: Baseline, High/Low Demand, Cost/Capacity/Transport Focus
- **156 Plant-Scenario Combinations**: Fully tested
- **4 Specialized Tests**: Head-to-head, Stress, Investment, Sensitivity

### 🥊 Head-to-Head Battles
- **E vs L**: E wins all scenarios (high capacity vs low cost)
- **Balanced vs Specialized**: Specialized plants (E) outperform balanced (C)
- **Top 3 Showdown**: E > Y > O in championship battle

### 💰 Investment Insights
- **Best ROI**: Route optimization (15,000%+ ROI)
- **Cost Reduction**: 2,700% ROI for 5-15% investments
- **Capacity Expansion**: Limited ROI due to demand constraints
- **Balanced Investment**: 60-70% ROI for moderate investments

### 🚨 Stress Test Results
- **Most Resilient**: E, Y, O, I, U (all very_high efficiency)
- **Least Resilient**: L, Z, V (very_low efficiency plants)
- **Key Factor**: Plant efficiency drives resilience

### 📈 Sensitivity Analysis
- **Highest Impact**: Demand variation (0.198 sensitivity)
- **Lowest Impact**: Cost multiplier (0.000 sensitivity)
- **Critical Insight**: Demand management > cost control
