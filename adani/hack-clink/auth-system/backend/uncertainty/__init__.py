"""Uncertainty package (Phase 4).

This package extends the Phase-3 deterministic optimization with:
- demand scenarios (Low/Normal/High)
- stochastic (expected-cost) optimization
- robust (worst-case) optimization

Important:
- The deterministic model in backend/optimization/ is unchanged.
- Uncertainty is optional and activated via UI.
